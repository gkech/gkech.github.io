# About
2022-10-14

I work at [Beat](https://thebeat.co/) as Software Engineer, focusing on the Driver experience within the app.
I'm also a part-time student at [National and Kapodistrian
University of Athens](https://www.di.uoa.gr/), working towards receiving my Master of Science in Computer Science.

I was member of the [Personalisation & Social Network Analysis Group](http://persona.iit.demokritos.gr/)
at National Centre of Scientific Research ["Demokritos"](https://www.iit.demokritos.gr/) where I worked on Dynamic Community Analysis topics. I received my 
Master of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Technical University of Crete](https://www.ece.tuc.gr/). There I worked
on the intersection of Multi-agent Systems, Artificial Intelligence and Game Theory, applied on the domain of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging (G2V&V2G).
